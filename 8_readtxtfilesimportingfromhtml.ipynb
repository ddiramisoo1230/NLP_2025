            "He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the stairs. His closet of a room was under the roof of a high, five-floor house and was more like a cupboard than a place in which to live. The landlady who provided him with the room and with dinner and service lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which was always open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him grimace and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her.\n",
            "\n",
            "This was not because he was cowardly and browbeaten, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself and isolated from everyone else that he dreaded meeting not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but even the anxieties of his position had recently ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. In fact, nothing that any landlady could do held any terror for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, all the while racking his brains for excuses, avoiding the issue, lying — no, he would rather creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, when he emerged onto the street that evening, he became acutely aware of his fears.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm . . . yes, everything is in someone’s hands and they let it all slip out of cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is people are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most . . . But I am talking too much. It’s because I babble that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I babble because I do nothing. I’ve learned to babble this last month, lying for days on end in my corner thinking . . . just nonsense. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that seriously possible? I’m not serious about it at all. It’s just a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle, the plaster, the scaffolding, the bricks and the dust all around him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to everyone who is unable to get out of town during the summer — all worked painfully upon the young man’s already overwrought nerves. The unbearable stench from the taverns, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a weekday, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the deepest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon, though, he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was around him and not caring to observe it. From time to time, because he used to talk to himself, he would mutter something, a habit to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had had almost nothing to eat.\n",
            "\n",
            "He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that part of town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Due to the proximity of the Haymarket, the number of establishments of a certain kind and the overwhelming numbers of craftsmen and workers crowded in these streets and alleys at the center of Petersburg, so many different types of people were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however strange, would have caused surprise. But there was such accumulated spite and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the cares of youth, he minded his rags least of all. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge cart dragged by a heavy cart-horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past, “Hey there, German hatter,” bellowing at the top of his voice and pointing at him — the young man stopped suddenly and clutched trembling at his hat. It was a tall round one from Zimmermann’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most hideous fashion. Not shame, however, but another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\n",

Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell's head and ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the Underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort . . . he had not merely seen the snake, he had been the snake, he knew it now . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A truly terrible thought then occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 What's he after, apart from followers?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn't have last time.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 I'm the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I'm the one Voldemort's trying to use, that's why they've got guards around me everywhere I go, it's not for my protection, it's for other people's, only it's not working, they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts . . . I did attack Mr Weasley last night, it was me. Voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you all right, Harry, dear?' whispered Mrs Weasley, leaning across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel. 'You don't look very well. Are you feeling sick?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They were all watching him. He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, dear, are you sure you're all right?' said Mrs Weasley in a worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place. 'You look ever so pale . . . are you sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours of sleep before dinner, all right?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the trolls-leg umbrella stand, up the stairs and into his and Ron's bedroom.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Here, he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus's empty picture frame, his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 How had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus . . . no, he couldn't be, he would know . . . perhaps Voldemort was an Animagus . . . yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into a snake of course . . . and when he's possessing me, then we both transform . . . that still doesn't explain how I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes . . . but then Voldemort's about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it's probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then, with a terrible stab of panic, he thought, but this is insane - if Voldemort's possessing me, I'm giving him a clear view into the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He'll know who's in the Order and where Sirius is . . . and I've heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was only one thing for it: he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them sate over the holidays at least . . . but no, that wouldn't do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure. What if it was Seamus, Dean or Neville next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach. He had no alternative: he was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts - well, her cage would be one less thing to carry - he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said, 'Running away, are we?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on his face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not running away, no,' said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I thought,' said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, 'that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave? It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's not my own neck I'm saving,' said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, I see,' said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard, 'this is no cowardly flight - you are being noble.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, 'I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry span round.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What is it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' \\\\Stay where you are.\\\\\\\" '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I haven't moved!' said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob. 'So what's the message?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I have just given it to you, dolt,' said Phineas Nigellus smoothly. 'Dumbledore says, \\\\\\\"Stay where you are.\\\\\\\" '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why?' said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. 'Why does he want me to stay? What else did he say?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nothing whatsoever,' said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So that's it, is it?' he said loudly. ' \\\\\\\"Stay where you are\\\\\\\"? That's all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those Dementors, loo! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won't bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You know,' said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, 'this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore's orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognise danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realise what the Dark Lord may be planning - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He is planning something to do with me, then?' said Harry swiftly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Did I say that?' said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves. 'Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising . . . good-day to you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fine, go then!' Harry bellowed at the empty frame. 'And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself face down on the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles . . . it seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe . . . he was so tired . . . he was scared to sleep . . . yet he did not know how long he could fight it . . . Dumbledore had told him to stay . . . that must mean he was allowed to sleep . . . but he was scared . . . what if it happened again?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was sinking into shadows . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start. He was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He reached the black door but could not open it. . . he stood gazing at it, desperate for entry . . . something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond . . . a prize beyond his dreams . . . if only his scar would stop prickling . . . then he would be able to think more clearly . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry,' said Ron's voice, from far, far away, 'Mum says dinners ready, but she'll save you something if you want to stay in bed.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He doesn't want to be on his own with me, Harry thought. Not after what he heard Moody say.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He supposed none of them would want him there any more, now that they knew what was inside him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company on them. He turned over on to his other side and, after a while, dropped back off to sleep. He woke much later, in the early hours of the morning, his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting around the room, he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half-wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore . . . if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all.*Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Around six o'clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I know you're in there,' said Hermione's voice. 'Will you please come out? I want to talk to you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What are you doing here?' Harry asked her, pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped. 'I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione. 'So, I've come here for Christmas.' There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold. 'But don t tell Ron. I told him skiing's really good because he kept laughing so much. Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they'll understand. Anyway,' she said briskly, 'let's go to your bedroom, Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. 'Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit. So . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How're you feeling?' asked Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fine,' said Harry stiffly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, don't lie, Harry,' she said impatiently. 'Ron and Ginny say you've been hiding from everyone since you got back from St Mungo's.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They do, do they?' said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you have!' she said. 'And you won't look at any of us!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's you lot who won't look at me!' said Harry angrily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Very funny,' snapped Harry, turning away.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply. 'Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah?' growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside. 'All been talking about me, have you? Well, I'm getting used to it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, 'seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he wheeled round.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I forgot,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Tin sorry,' Harry said, and he meant it. 'So . . . so, do you think I'm being possessed, then?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, can you remember everything you've been doing?' Ginny asked. 'Are there big blank periods where you don't know what you've been up to?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry racked his brains.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply. 'When he did it to me, I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time. I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, you've had these dreams before,' Hermione said. 'You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head. T was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake . . . what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London - ?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 'you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You didn't leave your bed, male,' said Ron. T saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense . . . without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 I'm not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeaks room, singing 'God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs' at the top of his voice.*How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. Thanks for the Broom Compass, it's excellent; beats Hermione's - she got me a homework planner - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione's handwriting on it. She had given him, too, a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like: 'Do it today or later you'll pay!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving colour illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the DA. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr and Mrs Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside-down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Merry Christmas,' said George. 'Don't go downstairs for a bit.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why not?' said Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Mum's crying again,' said Fred heavily. 'Percy sent back his Christmas jumper.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Without a note,' added George. 'Hasn't asked how Dad is or visited him or anything.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We tried to comfort her,' said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait. Told her Percy's nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Didn't work,' said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. 'So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's that supposed to be, anyway?' asked Fred, squinting at Dobbys painting. 'Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's Harry!' said George, pointing at the back of the picture, 'says so on the back!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good likeness,' said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: 'If you've dotted the \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\"s and crossed the \\\\\\\"t\\\\\\\"s then you may do whatever you please!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They got up and dressed. They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling 'Merry Christmas' to one another. On their way downstairs they met Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Thanks for the book, Harry,' she said happily. 'I've been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! And that perfume's really unusual, Ron.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No problem,' said Ron. 'Who's that for, anyway?' he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Kreacher,' said Hermione brightly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It had better not be clothes!' Ron warned her. 'You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can't set him free!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It isn't clothes,' said Hermione, 'although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it's a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What bedroom?' said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom, more a kind of - 'den,' said Hermione. 'Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them 'Merry Christmas', and they all averted their eyes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So, is this Kreacher's bedroom?' said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry. Harry had never seen it open.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. 'Er . . . I think we'd better knock.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He must be sneaking around upstairs,' he said, and without further ado pulled open the door. 'Urgh!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot of space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered up at him haughtily, including - he felt a little jolt in his stomach - the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore's Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreachers favourite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I think I'll just leave his present here,' said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly. 'He'll find it later, that'll be fine.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Come to think of it,' said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, 'has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I haven't seen him since the night we came back here,' said Harry. 'You were ordering him out of the kitchen.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah . . .' said Sirius, frowning. 'You know, I think that's the last time I saw him, too . . . he must be hiding upstairs somewhere.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He couldn't have left, could he?' said Harry. 'I mean, when you said \\\\\\\"out\\\\\\\", maybe he thought you meant get out of the house?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No, no, house-elves can't leave unless they're given clothes. They're tied to their family's house,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They can leave the house if they really want to,' Harry contradicted him. 'Dobby did, he left the Malfoy's' to give me warnings two years ago. He had to punish himself afterwards, but he still managed it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, 'I'll look for him later, I expect I'll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother's old bloomers or something. Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died . . . but I mustn't get my hopes up.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Fred, George and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry a:id Hermione were planning to pay Mr Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to 'borrow' a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the consent of its owner, had been enlarged with a spell like the Weasleys' old Ford Anglia had once been. Although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably. Mrs Weasley hesitated before getting inside - Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of travelling without magic - but, finally, the cold outside and her children's pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The journey to St Mungo's was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital. Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them. They strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The reception area looked pleasantly festive: the crystal orbs that illuminated St Mungo's had been coloured red and gold to become gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every doorway; and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner, each one topped with a gleaming gold star. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a satsuma jammed up her left nostril.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Family argument, eh?' smirked the blonde witch behind the desk. 'You're the third I've seen today . . . Spell Damage, fourth floor.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They found Mr Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Everything all right, Arthur?' asked Mrs Weasley, after they had all greeted Mr Weasley and handed over their presents.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fine, fine,' said Mr Weasley, a little too heartily. 'You - er - 'haven't seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Mrs Weasley suspiciously, 'why?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nothing, nothing,' said Mr Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his pile of gifts. 'Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, Harry - this is absolutely wonderful!' For he had just opened Harry's gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr Weasley's answer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry's hand, she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Arthur,' she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, 'you've had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn't need doing until tomorrow.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Mr Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest. 'No, no - it's nothing - it's - 'I - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He seemed to deflate under Mrs Weasley's piercing gaze.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well - now don't get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea . . . he's the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine . . . I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they're called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on - on Muggle wounds - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr Weasley; Bill muttered something s.bout getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Do you mean to tell me,' said Mrs Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, 'that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not messing about, Molly, dear,' said Mr Weasley imploringly, 'it was just - just something Pye and I thought we'd try - only, most unfortunately - well, with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Meaning?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well . . . well, I don't know whether you know what - what stitches are?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,' said Mrs Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, 'but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be that stupid - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I fancy a cup of tea, too,' said Harry, jumping to his feet.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione, Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him. As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs Weasley shriek, 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Typical Dad,' said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor. 'Stitches . . . I ask you . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,' said Hermione fairly. 'I suppose something in that snake's venom dissolves them or something. I wonder where the tearoom is?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fifth floor,' said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcomewitch's desk.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They walked along the corridor, through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And what's that supposed to be?' he asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' 'Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Watch who you're calling gruesome!' said Ron, his ears turning red.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' - the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels' eyes - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I have not got spattergroit!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'They're freckles!' said Ron furiously. 'Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What floor's this?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I think it's the fifth,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nah, it's the fourth,' said Harry, 'one more -\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass. He had wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Blimey!' said Ron, also staring at the man.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, my goodness,' said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless. 'Professor Lockhart.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Their ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, hello there!' he said. 'I expect you'd like my autograph, would you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hasn't changed much, has he?' Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - how are you, Professor?' said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Ron's malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart's memory so badly that he had landed in St Mungo's in the first place, though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron's memories at the time, Harry's sympathy was limited.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm very well indeed, thank you!' said Lockhart exuberantly, palling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket. 'Mow, how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing now, you know!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - we don't want any at the moment, thanks,' said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, 'Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldn't you be in a ward?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The smile faded slowly from Lockhart's face. For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry, then he said, 'Haven't we met?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er . . . yeah, we have,' said Harry. 'You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Teach?' repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. 'Me? Did I?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I? Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called, 'Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A motherly-looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, Gilderoy, you've got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day, too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can't think why, he's such a sweetie, aren't you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We're doing autographs!' Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. They want loads of them, won't take no for an answer! I just hope we've got enough photographs!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Listen to him,' said the Healer, taking Lockhart's arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old. 'He was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back. Will you step this way? He's in a closed ward, you know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door's usually kept locked . . . not that he's dangerous! But,' she lowered her voice to a whisper, 'he's a bit of a danger to himself, bless him . . . doesn't know who he is, you see, wanders off and can't remember how to get back . . . it is nice of you to have come to see him.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er,' said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, 'actually, we were just - er -'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron's feeble mutter of 'going to have a cup of tea' trailed away into nothingness. They looked at each other helplessly, then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Let's not stay long,' Ron said quietly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey Ward and muttered, 'Alohomora.' The door swung open and she led the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy's arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This is our long-term residents' ward,' she informed Harry, Ron,\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione and Ginny in a low voice. 'For permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself; and we've seen a real improvement in Mr Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn't speaking any language w: recognise yet. Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I'll leave you all to chat.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry looked around. The ward bore unmistakeable signs of being a permanent home to its residents. They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr Weasley's ward; the wall around Gilderoy's headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of himself, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing. The moment he had been deposited in his chair b> the Healer, Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him, seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You can put them in envelopes,' he said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them. 'I am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail . . . Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly . . . I just wish I knew why . . .' He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigour. 'I suspect it is simply my good looks . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him. Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent. At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Here you are, Agnes,' said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents. 'See, not forgotten, are you? And your son's sent an owl to say he's visiting tonight, so that's nice, isn't it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Agnes gave several loud barks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And look, Broderick, you've been sent a pot plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month; they'll brighten things up, won't they?' said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand. 'And - oh, Mrs Longbottom, are you leaving already?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's head span round. The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed - Neville.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realised who the people in the end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had also looked up at the sound of the name 'Longbottom', and before Harry could stop him had called out, 'Neville!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's us, Neville!' said Ron brightly, getting to his feet. 'Have you seen - '? Lockhart's here! Who've you been visiting?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Friends of yours, Neville, dear?' said Neville's grandmother graciously, bearing down upon them all.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ah, yes,' said his grandmother, looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shrivelled, clawlike hand for him to shake. 'Yes, yes, I know who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - thanks,' said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at him, but surveyed his own feet, the colour deepening in his face all the while.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And you two are clearly Weasleys,' Mrs Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. 'Yes, I know your parents - not well, of course - but fine people, fine people . . . and you must be Hermione Granger?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs Longbottom knew her name, but shook hands all the same.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, Neville's told me all about you. Helped him out of a few sticky spots, haven't you? He's a good boy,' she said, casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville, 'but be hasn't got his father's talent, I'm afraid to say.' And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Ron, looking amazed. (Harry wanted to stamp on Ron's foot, but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unnoticed when you're wearing jeans rather than robes.) 'Is that your dad down the end, Neville?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's this?' said Mrs Longbottom sharply. 'Haven't you told your friends about your parents, Neville?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling and shook his head. Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of!' said Mrs Longbottom angrily. 'You should be proud, Neville, proud! They didn't give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm not ashamed,' said Neville, very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, you've got a funny way of showing it!' said Mrs Longbottom. 'My son and his wife,' she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, 'were tortured into insanity by You-Know-Who's followers.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths. Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville's parents and looked mortified.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community,' Mrs Longbottom went on. 'Highly gifted, the pair of them. I - yes, Alice dear, what is it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville's mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody's old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions towards Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Again?' said Mrs Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. 'Very well, Alice dear, very well - Neville, take it, whatever it is.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Very nice, dear,' said Neville's grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his mother on the shoulder.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Neville said quietly, Thanks, Mum.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he'd ever found anything less funny in his life.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we'd better get back,' sighed Mrs Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves. 'Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the sweet wrapper into his pocket.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The door closed behind them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I never knew,' said Hermione, who looked tearful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nor did I,' said Ron rather hoarsely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nor me,' whispered Ginny.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They all looked at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I did,' he said glumly. 'Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone . . . that's what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville's parents until they lost their minds.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Bellatrix Lestrange did that?' whispered Hermione, horrified. That woman Kreacher's got a photo of in his den?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart's angry voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look, I didn't learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!'\\\"\",\n          \"  \\\\The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \\\\\\\"And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can't stop them,\\\\\\\" said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, \\\\\\\"I mean to say, who can?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That remains to be seen,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \\\\\\\"But as all twelve of us have voted -\\\\\\\"  Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.  'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?\\\\\\\" he roared.  \\\\\\\"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Malfoy. \\\\\\\"I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeh can' take Dumbledore!\\\\\\\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \\\\\\\"Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin' next!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy.  \\\\\\\"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But -\\\\\\\" stuttered Fudge.  \\\\\\\"No!\\\\\\\"growled Hagrid.  Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's cold gray ones.  \\\\\\\"However,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \\\\\\\"you will find that I will  * 26$*  ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.  Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.  \\\\\\\"We're taking no more chances,\\\\\\\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \\\\\\\"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . .\\\\\\\"  With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school\\u00a0that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.  Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself \\\\\\\"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\\\\\\\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?  Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.  One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.  \\\\\\\"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \\\\\\\"I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever\\u00a0had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling in ......  Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron.  \\\\\\\"Sir,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy loudly. \\\\\\\"Sir, why don't you apply for the headmaster's job?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Now, now, Malfoy,\\\\\\\" said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thin- lipped smile. \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah, right,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, smirking. \\\\\\\"I expect you'd have Father's vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir -\\\\\\\"  Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron.  \\\\\\\"I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now,\\\\\\\" Malfoy went on. \\\\\\\"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn't Granger -\\\\\\\"  The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.  \\\\\\\"Let me at him,\\\\\\\" Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms. \\\\\\\"I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare hands -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology,\\\\\\\" barked Snape over the class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only\\u00a0safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.  The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione.  Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \\\\\\\"I just want to say, Harry, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you. I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We're all in the same boat now, and, well -\\\\\\\"  He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.  Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron.  \\\\\\\"That Draco Malfoy character,\\\\\\\" said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, \\\\\\\"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he? D'you know, I think he might be Slytherin's heir.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That's clever of you,\\\\\\\" said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry.  \\\\\\\"Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry?\\\\\\\" Ernie asked.  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.  A second later, Harry spotted something.  Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears.  \\\\\\\"Ouch! What're you -\\\\\\\"\\u00a0  Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun.  \\\\\\\"Oh, yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \\\\\\\"But we can't follow them now -\\\\\\\"  Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously.  Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up.  \\\\\\\"Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . .\\\\\\\"  And Ron looked even unhappier about that.  At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot.  \\\\\\\"We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\\\\\\\" Harry told Ron. \\\\\\\"We can take Fang with us. He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. \\\\\\\"Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?\\\\\\\" he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart's classroom.  Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \\\\\\\"There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...  Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.  Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Come now,\\\\\\\" he cried, beaming around him. \\\\\\\"Why all these long faces?\\\\\\\"  People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.  \\\\\\\"Don't you people realize,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, \\\\\\\"the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Says who?\\\\\\\" said Dean Thomas loudly.  \\\\\\\"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two.  \\\\\\\"Oh, yes he would,\\\\\\\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.  \\\\\\\"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid's arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.  Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.  \\\\\\\"We weren't there, remember?\\\\\\\" Harry muttered.  But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight.  Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.  The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had no -\\u00a0  where else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight.  Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.  Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole.  It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.  \\\\\\\"'Course,\\\\\\\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \\\\\\\"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but. . .\\\\\\\"  His voice trailed away hopefully.  They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.  Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Come on, Fang, we're going for a walk,\\\\\\\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.  Harry took out his wand, murmured, \\\\\\\"Lumos!\\\\\\\" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.  \\\\\\\"Good thinking,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Id light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or something ......  Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.  \\\\\\\"Okay,\\\\\\\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \\\\\\\"I'm ready. Let's go.\\\\\\\"  So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.  Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.\\u00a0  Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang's nose.  \\\\\\\"What d'you reckon?\\\\\\\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.  \\\\\\\"We've come this far,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.  They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.  Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard.  \\\\\\\"There's something moving over there,\\\\\\\" Harry breathed. \\\\\\\"Listen ... sounds like something big ......  They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.  \\\\\\\"Oh, no,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Shut up,\\\\\\\" said Harry frantically. \\\\\\\"It'll hear you.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hear me?\\\\\\\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \\\\\\\"It's already heard Fang!\\\\\\\"  The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anyone in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself. The muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat.The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed.On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed.Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand.The usual low whisper of \\\\Severus Snape\\\\\\\" greeted him, the chill wind swept him, and his tongue rolled up for a moment.\\\\\\\"I didn't kill you,\\\\\\\" he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, \\\\\\\"I've got news, and you won't like it.\\\\\\\"The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone; Copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf who now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus's locket bouncing on his thin chest.\\\\\\\"Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,\\\\\\\" croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered.\\\\\\\"What's happened?\\\\\\\" Ron asked apprehensively. He are Hermione had been pouring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment.A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read:SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMEDAS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER\\\\\\\"No!\\\\\\\" said Ron and Hermione loudly.Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud.\\\\\\\"Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" 'I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values \\u00a8C' Like committing murder and cutting off people's ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore's study \\u00a8C Merlin's pants!\\\\\\\" she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, \\\\\\\"I'll be back in a minute!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"'Merlin's pants'?\\\\\\\" repeated Ron, looking amused. \\\\\\\"She must be upset.\\\\\\\" He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape.\\\\\\\"The other teachers won't stand for this, McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won't accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Death Eaters,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it's all friends together. And,\\\\\\\" Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, \\\\\\\"I can't see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape, it'll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban \\u00a8C and that's if they're lucky. I reckon they'll stay to try and protect the students.\\\\\\\"Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large curcen in his hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so.\\\\\\\"Thanks, Kreacher,\\\\\\\" said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape's face. \\\\\\\"Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.\\\\\\\"He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher's cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus's locket: Today's French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted.\\\\\\\"There are still a load of Death Eaters watching this house,\\\\\\\" he told Ron as he ate, \\\\\\\"more than usual. It's like they're hoping we'll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.\\\\\\\"Ron glanced at his watch.\\\\\\\"I've been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn't it?\\\\\\\"In his mind's eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape's new regime.\\\\\\\"They nearly saw me coming back in just now,\\\\\\\" Harry said, \\\\\\\"I landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I do that every time. Oh, here she is,\\\\\\\" Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. \\\\\\\"And what in the name of Merlin's most baggy Y Fronts was that about?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I remembered this,\\\\\\\" Hermione panted.She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much ease, into the bag's capacious depths.\\\\\\\"Phineas Nigellus,\\\\\\\" Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.\\\\\\\"Sorry?\\\\\\\" said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to travel between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster's office at Hogwarts: the circular cower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore's collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it ad been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.\\\\\\\"Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,\\\\\\\" Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. \\\\\\\"But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Good thinking!\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking impressed.\\\\\\\"Thank you,\\\\\\\" smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. \\\\\\\"So, Harry, what else happened today?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Nothing,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw your dad though, Ron. He looks fine.\\\\\\\"Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. The had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious.\\\\\\\"Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,\\\\\\\" Ron said. \\\\\\\"That's why we haven't seen Umbridge, she'd never walk, she'd think she's too important.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?\\\\\\\" Hermione asked.\\\\\\\"Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,\\\\\\\" said Ron.\\\\\\\"How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?\\\\\\\" Hermione asked, her soupspoon suspended in midair.\\\\\\\"Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But you never told us that!\\\\\\\"Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen.\\\\\\\"There's nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!\\\\\\\" she said, flipping feverishly through the pages.\\\\\\\"Well, does it really matter?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Ron, it all matters! If we're going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they're bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We've been over and over this, I mean, what's the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren't even bothering to tell us \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You do realize, don't you, that there's probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I think we should do it tomorrow,\\\\\\\" said Harry.Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup.\\\\\\\"Tomorrow?\\\\\\\" repeated Hermione. \\\\\\\"You aren't serious, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I am,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I don't think we're going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There's already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn't open.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Unless,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"she's found a way of opening it and she's now possessed.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Wouldn't make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,\\\\\\\" Harry shrugged.Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought.\\\\\\\"We know everything important,\\\\\\\" Harry went on, addressing Hermione. \\\\\\\"We know they've stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry; We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge's office is, because of what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his mate \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"'I'll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,'\\\\\\\" Hermione recited immediately.\\\\\\\"Exactly,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But we haven't got any!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"If the plan works, we will have,\\\\\\\" Harry continued calmly.\\\\\\\"I don't know, Harry, I don't know ... There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance ...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"That'll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"It's time to act.\\\\\\\"He could tell from Ron's and Hermione's faces that they were scared; he was not particularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebody's briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione.\\\\\\\"All right,\\\\\\\" said Ron slowly, \\\\\\\"let's say we go for it tomorrow ... I think it should just be me and Harry.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Oh, don't start that again!\\\\\\\" sighed Hermione. \\\\\\\"I thought we'd settled this.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"It's one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different. Hermione,\\\\\\\" Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. \\\\\\\"You're on the list of Muggle-borns who didn't present themselves for interrogation!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"And you're supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone shouldn't go, it's Harry, he's got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Fine, I'll stay here,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won't you?\\\\\\\"As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry's forehead. His hand jumped to it. He saw Hermione's eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes.\\\\\\\"Well, if all three of us go we'll have to Disapparate separately,\\\\\\\" Ron was saying. \\\\\\\"We can't all fit under the Cloak anymore.\\\\\\\"Harry's scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried forward.\\\\\\\"Master has not finished his soup, would master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Thanks, Kreacher, but I'll be back in a minute \\u00a8C er \\u00a8C bathroom.\\\\\\\"Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes ....He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread houses. He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mounting excitement ...The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry's face: humor gone, terror replacing it ....\\\\\\\"Gregorovitch?\\\\\\\" said a high, cold voice.She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented her shutting him out ...\\\\\\\"I want Gregorovitch.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!\\\\\\\" she cried, shaking her head. \\\\\\\"He no live here! He no live here! I know him not!\\\\\\\"Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand.\\\\\\\"Where is he?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Das wei&szlig; ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!\\\\\\\"He raised his hand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light \\u00a8C\\\\\\\"Harry! HARRY!\\\\\\\"He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door again.\\\\\\\"Harry, open up!\\\\\\\"He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.\\\\\\\"What were you doing?\\\\\\\" asked Hermione sternly.\\\\\\\"What d'you think I was doing?\\\\\\\" asked Harry with feeble bravado.\\\\\\\"You were yelling your head off!\\\\\\\" said Ron.\\\\\\\"Oh yeah ... I must've dozed off or \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry, please don't insult our intelligence,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, taking deep breaths. \\\\\\\"We know your scar hurt downstairs, and you're white as a sheet.\\\\\\\"Harry sat down on the edge of the bath.\\\\\\\"Fine. I've just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he's probably killed her whole family. And he didn't need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there ...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry, you aren't supposed to let this happen anymore!\\\\\\\" Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. \\\\\\\"Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! HE thought the connection was dangerous \\u00a8C Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Because it means I know what he's doing,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\\\\\\"So you're not even going to try to shut him out?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hermione, I can't. You know I'm lousy at Occlumency. I never got the hang of it.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You never really tried!\\\\\\\" she said hotly. \\\\\\\"I don't get it, Harry \\u00a8C do you like having this special connection or relationship or what \\u00a8C whatever \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up.\\\\\\\"Like it?\\\\\\\" he said quietly. \\\\\\\"Would you like it?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I \\u00a8C no \\u00a8C I'm sorry, Harry. I just didn't mean \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he's most dangerous. But I'm going to use it.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Dumbledore \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else's. I want to know why he's after Gregorovitch.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Who?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He's a foreign wandmaker,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"He made Krum's wand and Krum reckons he's brilliant.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But according to you,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"Voldemort's got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he's already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better ... or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn't know.\\\\\\\"Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back.\\\\\\\"Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, \\\\\\\"but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Because I know it wasn't me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!\\\\\\\"They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemort's mind. To his relief, Ron intervened.\\\\\\\"Drop it,\\\\\\\" he advised her. \\\\\\\"It's up to him. And if we're going to the Ministry tomorrow, don't you reckon we should go over the plan?\\\\\\\"Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart.They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius's room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly.Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.\\\\\\\"You look terrible,\\\\\\\" was Ron's greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry.\\\\\\\"Not for long,\\\\\\\" said Harry, yawning.They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review.\\\\\\\"Robes,\\\\\\\" she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, \\\\\\\"Polyjuice Potion ... Invisibility Cloak ... Decoy Detonators ... You should each take a couple just in case ... Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Norgat, Extendable Ears ...\\\\\\\"They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned.\\\\\\\"Bless him,\\\\\\\" said Ron fondly, \\\\\\\"and when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.\\\\\\\"They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square.Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry.After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight o'clock.\\\\\\\"Right then,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, checking her watch. \\\\\\\"she ought to be here in about five minutes. When I've Stunned her \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hermione, we know,\\\\\\\" said Ron sternly. \\\\\\\"And I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?\\\\\\\"Hermione squealed.\\\\\\\"I nearly forgot! Stand back \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it look as thought it was still closed.\\\\\\\"And now,\\\\\\\" she said, turning, back to face the other two in the alleyway, \\\\\\\"we put on the Cloak again \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" \\u00a8C and we wait,\\\\\\\" Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione's head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry.Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness: the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione's silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.\\\\\\\"Nicely done, Hermione,\\\\\\\" said Ron, emerging behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch's head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch's handbag.\\\\\\\"She's Mafalda Hopkirk,\\\\\\\" he said, reading a small card that identified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. \\\\\\\"You'd better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.\\\\\\\"He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M. which he had taken from the witch's purse.Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda's spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch.\\\\\\\"We're running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.\\\\\\\"They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them.\\\\\\\"Oh, hello, Mafalda.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hello!\\\\\\\" said Hermione in a quavery voice, \\\\\\\"How are you today?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Not so good, actually,\\\\\\\" replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast.As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them.\\\\\\\"I'm sorry to hear you're under the weather,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, talking firmly over the little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street. \\\\\\\"Here, have a sweet.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Eh? Oh, no thanks \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I insist!\\\\\\\" said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one.The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head.\\\\\\\"Oh dear!\\\\\\\" she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. \\\\\\\"Perhaps you'd better take the day off!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"No \\u00a8C no!\\\\\\\" He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight. \\\\\\\"I must \\u00a8C today \\u00a8C must go \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But that's just silly!\\\\\\\" said Hermione, alarmed. \\\\\\\"You can't go to work in this state \\u00a8C I think you ought to go to St. Mungo's and get them to sort you out.\\\\\\\"The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the main street.\\\\\\\"You simply can't go to work like this!\\\\\\\" cried Hermione.At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a reposed Hermione to claw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit.\\\\\\\"Urgh,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, holding up the skirt of her robe to avoid the puddles of sick. \\\\\\\"It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard's bag, \\\\\\\"but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn't he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.\\\\\\\"Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag.\\\\\\\"Weird he wasn't wearing them today, wasn't it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, I'm Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Now wait here,\\\\\\\" Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, \\\\\\\"and we'll be back with some hairs for you.\\\\\\\"He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared.\\\\\\\"We don't know who he is,\\\\\\\" Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, \\\\\\\"but he's gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he's pretty tall, you'll need bigger robes ...\\\\\\\"She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change.Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two.\\\\\\\"Blimey, that's scary,\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him.\\\\\\\"Take one of Mafalda's tokens,\\\\\\\" Hermione told Harry, \\\\\\\"and let's go, it's nearly nine.\\\\\\\"They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES.\\\\\\\"See you in a moment, then,\\\\\\\" said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.\\\\\\\"Morning, Reg!\\\\\\\" called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. \\\\\\\"Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?\\\\\\\"The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle.\\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" he said, \\\\\\\"stupid, isn't it?\\\\\\\"And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.To Harry's left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.\\\\\\\"We have to flush ourselves in?\\\\\\\" he whispered.\\\\\\\"Looks like it,\\\\\\\" Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly.They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet.He knew at once that he had done the right thing; thought he appeared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic.He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT.Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs. Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him.\\\\\\\"Out of the way, can't y \\u00a8C oh, sorry, Runcorn.\\\\\\\"Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man who Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating.\\\\\\\"Psst!\\\\\\\" said a voice, and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them.\\\\\\\"You got in all right, then?\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered to Harry.\\\\\\\"No, he's still stuck in the hog,\\\\\\\" said Ron.\\\\\\\"Oh, very funny ... It's horrible, isn't it?\\\\\\\" she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. \\\\\\\"Have you seen what they're sitting on?\\\\\\\"Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards.\\\\\\\"Muggles,\\\\\\\" whispered Hermione, \\\\\\\"In their rightful place. Come on, let's get going.\\\\\\\"They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, \\\\\\\"Cattermole!\\\\\\\"They looked around: Harry's stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore's death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them.The man's scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, \\\\\\\"Morning, Yaxley!\\\\\\\" Yaxley ignored them.\\\\\\\"I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, Cattermole. It's still raining in there.\\\\\\\"Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke.\\\\\\\"Raining ... in your office? That's \\u00a8C that's not good, is it?\\\\\\\"Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley's eyes widened.\\\\\\\"You think it's funny, Cattermole, do you?\\\\\\\"A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off.\\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"no, of course \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I'm quite surprised you're not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.\\\\\\\"Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She cough feebly and turned away.\\\\\\\"I \\u00a8C I \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" stammered Ron.\\\\\\\"But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,\\\\\\\" said Yaxley, \\\\\\\" \\u00a8C not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth \\u00a8C and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do this job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" whispered Ron.\\\\\\\"Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an hour, your wife's Blood Status will be in even greater doubt than it is now.\\\\\\\"The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward.\\\\\\\"What am I going to do?\\\\\\\" Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. \\\\\\\"If I don't turn up, my wife ... I mean, Cattermole's wife \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"We'll come with you, we should stick together \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" began Harry, but Ron shook his head feverishly.\\\\\\\"That's mental, we haven't got much time. You two find Umbridge, I'll go and sort out Yaxley's office \\u00a8C but how do I stop a raining?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Try Finite Incantatem,\\\\\\\" said Hermione at once, \\\\\\\"that should stop the rain if it's a hex or curse; if it doesn't something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Say it again, slowly \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, \\\\\\\"Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,\\\\\\\" and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.\\\\\\\"Morning, Albert,\\\\\\\" said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttering \\\\\\\"Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I'm pretty confident I'll get his job now!\\\\\\\"He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more.\\\\\\\"Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services,\\\\\\\" said the disembodied witch's voice.Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione said, very fast, \\\\\\\"Actually, Harry, I think I'd better go after him, I don't think he knows what he's doing and if he gets caught the whole thing \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.\\\\\\\"The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood before them, two of them deep in conversation: a long-haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and a squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest.\\u00a0\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          7,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
